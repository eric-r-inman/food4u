# Stop hook: gates the end of a turn on a clean template-compliance review.
#
# This is not a "please remember to review" nudge — it is deterministic and
# not skippable.  Whenever the working tree holds un-reviewed code or config
# changes, the hook blocks the turn from ending until the template-compliance
# subagent has run *and reported* COMPLIANCE: PASS.
#
# The review itself is the native subagent (a Task the assistant invokes);
# this hook only inspects the git working tree and the transcript in pure
# shell.  There is no model discretion to skip it and no nested `claude`.
#
# Convergence: each time the assistant addresses findings and re-runs the
# reviewer, the next Stop re-reads the verdict and releases once it is PASS.
# A bounded round cap (MAX_ROUNDS) keeps a finding the assistant genuinely
# cannot resolve from wedging the session — after the cap the gate releases
# and the unresolved findings stand in the conversation for the human.
#
# Prose-only changes (.md, .org, .txt, .rst, .adoc, LICENSE) never trigger a
# review; that work is not worth the token spend.

set -euo pipefail

# Consecutive blocks allowed within one turn before the gate gives up.  The
# first block is usually just "you have not run the reviewer yet", so this
# leaves a few rounds for actually resolving findings.
